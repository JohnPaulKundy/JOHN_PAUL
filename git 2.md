## The git log command
  
   The Git Log tool allows you to view information about previous commits 
   that have occurred in a project. The simplest version of the log command 
   shows the commits that lead up to the state of the currently checked out branch
   
 ## git log syntax
 
   Display All Commits. You can force the log tool display all commits 
   (regardless of the branch checked out) by using the â€“all option.
   $ git log --all
   
   View n Most Recent Commits. This can be accomplished using the -<n> option. 
   Replace <n> with the number of commits you would like to see. i.e.
    To see the 3 most recent commits:  $ git log -3
